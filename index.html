            1. Offer valid on qualifying purchases of eligible Apple products
            from November 25, 2022, to November 28, 2022, at a qualifying
            location. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last.
            Customers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the
            Promotion Product (depending on their purchase) off the price of the
            Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart.
            Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly
            statement for Apple Card Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with
            this promotion: A purchase of an Eligible Product made when
            selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.)
            as the payment type at checkout will receive an instant credit equal
            to the cost of the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from
            the price of the Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You will
            be charged one ACMI installment plan for the Eligible Product
            discounted by the instant credit. The value of the Promotion Product
            (i.e. the value of the Apple Gift Card) will also be charged in a
            separate second ACMI installment plan for the same number of months
            as the discounted Eligible Product. The total combined amount
            charged over the 2 separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the
            original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, you
            will receive and be charged for the Promotion Product (Apple Gift
            Card) in the amount of the applicable instant credit. ACMI is
            subject to credit approval and credit limit. Variable APRs for Apple
            Card other than ACMI range from 13.99% to 24.99% based on
            creditworthiness. Rates as of October 1, 2022. If you choose the
            pay-in-full or one-time-payment option for an ACMI-eligible purchase
            instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that
            purchase will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple
            Card. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI transactions and
            are subject to your standard purchase APR. See the Apple Card
            Customer Agreement at
